There's a bunch of python code in http://ugweb.cs.ualberta.ca/~c296/web/Quizzes/Quiz6.  

binaryheap.py : contains the binary heap we wrote in class
digraph.py : contains the directed graph class, with missing functions filled in, and a working least_cost_path
roadnetwork.py : contains the completed code that Jim proposed this week for encapsulating road networks data and functionality
edmonton_roads.txt : the Edmonton roads data file (with correct one-way roads)
simple_roads.txt : a simple fake network of roads

There are two functions in roadnetwork.py that are not implemented.  Your task is to implement those two functions.  You shouldn't need to make changes to any other file.  There are a couple of tests to illustrate the interface using the simple_roads.txt file, but you will likely want more extensive tests, possibly using the edmonton_roads.txt.
